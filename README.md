# Gut microbiome CVD diagnostic

## Problem Statement
Develop a machine learning strategy for gut microbiome-based diagnostic screening of diseases to accurately predict and classify various medical conditions based on the analysis of gut microbiota composition. The goal is to leverage machine learning algorithms to identify specific patterns and biomarkers within the gut microbiome data that can aid in early detection and diagnosis of diseases, enabling more effective and personalized healthcare interventions.

## Methodology:
- Gathered gut microbiome data from a diverse population
- Developed a machine learning model using advanced algorithms (Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classifier, Neural Network Classifier, Elastic Net classifier
- Trained the model on a large dataset of cardiovascular disease cases and controls.

## Findings
RF and neural networks performed better than other models, but they only achieved an AUC of ≈0.58, followed by elastic net (≈0.57 AUC), support vector machine (≈0.55 AUC), and decision tree (≈0.51 AUC).

## Results
Results:
Achieved high accuracy in distinguishing cardiovascular disease cases from controls. Identified key microbial markers associated with cardiovascular disease
